As part of my journey to become a proficient web developer, I undertook a project to create an imitation website based on an existing, well-designed website. Coded from scratch, this project allowed me to demonstrate my skills
in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to showcase my ability to replicate modern web design and functionality. The primary objective of this project was to create a visually and functionally accurate imitation of a selected website. 
This involved paying close attention to design details, interactive elements, and overall user experience. I utilized browser developer tools to inspect elements and accurately replicate styles, ensuring visual consistency. 
I debugged and refined my scripts, resulting in smooth performance and a more enjoyable user experience. Implementing interactivity with CSS and JavaScript required thorough planning and extensive testing to ensure seamless integration.

**FEATURES**

• Navigation Menu: Implemented a fully functional navigation menu that mirrors the original website, including toggled dropdown menus.
• Interactive Elements: Included various interactive elements such as a before and after image slider, drop-down menu, modals, and form validations using JavaScript.
• Animations and Transitions: Used CSS animations and transitions to enhance the user experience and make the website more engaging.
• Cross-Browser Compatibility: Tested and ensured compatibility across major web browsers.
